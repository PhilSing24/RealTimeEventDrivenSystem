# Documentation

This folder contains the project’s reference material, project-specific measurement guidance, and architecture decisions.

## Start Here
- `kdbx-real-time-architecture-measurement-notes.md`  
  Project-specific definitions for latency SLOs, timestamping, clock assumptions, and measurement points.

## Architecture Reference (Third-Party)
- `kdbx-real-time-architecture-reference.md`  
  Third-party reference material describing design patterns and trade-offs for real-time KDB-X systems.

## Architecture Decisions (ADRs)
- `decisions/adr-001-timestamps-and-latency-measurement.md`  
  Decision record defining what timestamps are captured, how latency is measured, and what is trusted under NTP/PTP.

## External Interfaces / APIs
- `api-binance.md`  
  Binance feed/API notes relevant to this project (event fields, semantics, sequencing, reconnect behavior).

## Source Material / Originals
- `reference/`  
  Source documents and any original artefacts used to derive the reference and notes.
